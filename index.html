            <p> Uttapam is a dish very similar to the dosa and is a speciality of Tamil Nadu food. It is made by
                grinding
                the
                Urad Dal and rice powder together. It is then allowed to ferment for a few hours and then slow fried
                over
                very minimal oil over a skillet. Uttapam is flat and crispy at the sides just like dosa but soft and
                doughy
                in the middle like an Idli. The uttapam is then given a little topping of tomatoes, onions, capsicum
                etc. </p>

            <p> Medhu Vada is popularly known as Vadai or Garelu. This is a doughnut-shaped crispy and fluffy Vada made
                from
                lentils. This savoury food made by grinding split black gram and then soaking it to the batter and
                finally
                deep-frying in oil in small portions. Apart from this, ginger, onion, pepper, green chillies, cumin are
                also
                added to increase the taste. Finally, it is then served with Coconut Chutney or Sambhar.</p>

            <p class="container-food__title">Pongal</p>
            <p> This is a staple meal during every auspicious festival of Tamil Nadu. Besides the rice and sweet milk,
                the
                dish is cooked with ingredients like cardamom, green gram, raisins and cashew nuts. According to the
                traditional beliefs, Pongal is cooked in open space in the sunlight, as it is dedicated to the sun god.
                The
                dish has two variants- one that's sweet another that's savoury which is served on banana leaves.</p>

            <p class="container-food__title">Rasam</p>
            <p> Rasam is my personal favourite! Tamarind forms the base of this soup-like dish, and added to it are
                tomatoes, pepper and cumin seed. The rasam is almost a pre-meal appetizer, which is light and doesn't
                fill
                you up too much before a meal. The rasam is a famous dish that is poured over the rice like a normal
                curry.
                Though it is almost colourless, it has a burst of flavour. You can also drink it as you would a soup. </p>
